#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering involves the use of engineering principles in a disciplined way to software system design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It encompasses structured methods, tools, and good practices for making the software reliable, scalable, efficient, and compliant with user requirements.

Software engineering is an amalgamation of various fields, for instance, programming, system architecture, database administration, and quality assurance. It is also bound by a systematic approach, for instance, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), involving planning, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Importance of Software Engineering:
Ensures Quality Software
Software engineering practices ensure that software products are developed using minimal bugs, high performance, and security, thus are reliable for individuals and businesses.

Increases Efficiency and Productivity
By adopting formal development techniques like Agile, Scrum, and DevOps, software engineering increases collaboration, speeds up development, and allows timely delivery.

Makes Scalability and Maintainability Possible
Well-engineered software is able to scale with growing user demands and can be easily altered to conform to changes, reducing long-term maintenance costs.

Increases Security and Data Protection
Software engineering adopts best practices in security, such as encryption and secure code guidelines, to protect confidential information from cyber attacks.

Drives Technological Innovation and Growth
Software engineering enables the creation of groundbreaking applications across industries like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, IoT, and blockchain to transform industries digitally.

Reduces Development Time and Expenses
Structured approaches help to prevent rework, minimize failures, and optimize resources, thereby lowering the overall cost of software development.

Maintains Adherence to Industry Regulations
Numerous industries demand software compliance with rules and standards (e.g., ISO, GDPR, HIPAA). Compliance is ensured by software engineering through the adherence to best practices.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

"Software engineering" was first used at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as a response to the Software Crisis—a time when software projects were failing due to poor management, high cost, and lack of structured development practices.
This watershed event laid the foundation for formalizing software development with emphasis on structured methods, systematic design, and project control.
The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s - 1980s)

Structured programming emerged as a response to the issue of creating large and complex software. It introduced the use of modular design, clear control structures (sequence, selection, and iteration), and procedural programming to render the code more readable and easier to maintain.
Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra proposed eliminating GOTO statements to enhance code structure and thus leading to more dependable software and simpler debugging.
Popular structured programming languages such as C, Pascal, and Ada went mainstream.
The Emergence of Agile Development (2001 - Present)

The Agile Manifesto in 2001 promoted flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid, waterfall-based approaches.
Agile methods such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) became popular, enabling teams to deliver software faster with incremental enhancements.
This innovation was a step towards customer-driven development, flexible planning, and cross-functional teamwork, allowing for the creation of more efficient and responsive software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning

It is the initial phase where the project objectives, requirements, scope, risks, and resources are identified.
A feasibility study is conducted to identify if the project is viable from the cost, time, and technology aspects.
Requirement Analysis

Here, software requirements are gathered and thoroughly analyzed.
Functional and non-functional requirements are captured through a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
Design

Software architecture and system design are created based on the gathered requirements.
High-Level Design (HLD) formulates the system architecture, while Low-Level Design (LLD) outlines module design.

Implementation (Coding)

Software development is done at this stage.
Code is implemented by developers as per the chosen programming languages, frameworks, and guidelines.
Testing

The software is tested to ascertain and rectify bugs, mistakes, and vulnerabilities.
Several methods of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Deployment

The software is deployed to a production environment where the users are able to use and access it.
Deployment is either performed incrementally (phase-wise release) or all at once (big bang release).

Maintenance & Support

Following deployment, the software is continuously monitored, updated, and improved.
Bug fixes, security patches, and feature enhancements are performed on the basis of user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology - Sequential, linear process where each phase is completed before moving to the next, while Agile Methodology - is Iterative and flexible process where development is done in small increments (sprints).
Waterfall Methodology - Rigid; changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed, while Agile Methodology - Highly flexible; changes can be made at any stage based on feedback.
Waterfall Methodology - Heavy documentation required before development begins while, Agile Methodology - Less documentation; more focus on working software and adaptability.
Waterfall Methodology - Entire software is delivered at the end of the project, while Agile Methodology - Software is delivered in increments, with usable features available early.

Waterfall is Suited For:
Government and Defence Projects – Requires strict documentation and fixed specifications.
Banking and Financial Applications – Requires high accuracy, compliance, and systematic validation.
Infrastructure & Building Projects – After completing one phase, going back is costly.
Agile is Suitable For:
Mobile App & Web Development – End-user requirements fluctuate frequently, so flexibility.
Startup Software Development – Rapid delivery and continuous refinement are necessary.
E-commerce & SaaS Products – New features must be tested and rolled out incrementally.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of creating and refining inputs (prompts) to obtain the most relevant, correct, and useful output from AI models. It involves structuring questions, statements, or instructions in a way that optimizes AI-generated outputs.

Role of Prompt Engineering in AI Interaction
Enhances Response Accuracy

Effective prompts reduce ambiguity and encourage the AI towards providing accurate and relevant responses.
Example: Rather than "Tell me about Python," a better prompt would be "Outline the key features and uses of Python programming."
Makes AI More Efficient

AI models are more efficient when they are provided with clear and formalized prompts that have fewer unnecessary round-trip clarifications.
Example: Rather than "Write a blog," a better prompt would be "Write a 500-word blog on the benefits of cloud computing for small business start-ups."
Improves AI Creativity and Output Quality

Different wording and context clues can help AI generate more creative and diverse results.
Example: "Write a short story about future AI-human collaboration" elicits more creative results than "Write a short story."
Facilitates Automation and Efficiency

Prompt design is key to AI-powered activities like content generation, code completion, customer support, and data analysis.
Example: AI chatbots utilize structured prompts to efficiently guide customer conversations.
Facilitates Enhanced AI Training and Refining

Researchers and developers use prompt engineering to improve the performance of AI models and give ethical, unbiased responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Describe how artificial intelligence is changing the healthcare industry by giving examples of its application."

Why the Improved Prompt is Better:
More Specific: Instead of inquiring more broadly about "technology," it is artificial intelligence within the healthcare field.
Clear Intent: It shows the scope (healthcare) and requirement (description + examples).
Direct & Concise: It avoids ambiguity, and thus it is easier for AI to generate a contextual and informative response.
